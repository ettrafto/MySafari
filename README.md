# Safari Photography Website

This website was created for **CS008** and showcases my photography from a safari trip to **Tanzania**. It’s a personal project that highlights my favorite moments, animals, and landscapes through an engaging and interactive layout.

## 🌍 Overview

The site is structured into several pages, each offering a unique window into my trip:

### 🏠 Home Page
- Displays a curated selection of my favorite photos.
- Includes text sharing the story and experience of my safari adventure.

### 🌟 Featured Page
- A full gallery of my favorite photographs from the trip.

### 🐾 Animals Page
- Allows users to filter and view images by specific animals.
- Users can click on silhouettes of animals to explore related photos.

### ⛰️ Landscapes Page
- Highlights my best landscape photography from the safari.

### 👤 About Me Page
- Shares fun and candid pictures of me during the trip.
- Features a **contact form** that lets users send me an email with their message and information.

## ✨ Purpose

This project combines personal storytelling with web design and photography. It serves both as a creative portfolio and a technical demonstration of HTML, CSS, and basic interactivity.
